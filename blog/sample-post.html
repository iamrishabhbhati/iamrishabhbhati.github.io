            <p>
                Every time I get a new dataset, the first thing I want to do is just look at
                it. Not build any model, not write any report — just <strong>understand what
                    I'm working with</strong>. That's essentially what EDA is, and over time I've
                built a process that works for me.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 1 — Load it and look at it</h2>
            <p>
                Sounds obvious, but I always start by printing the first few rows and checking
                the shape of the data. How many rows? How many columns? What are the column
                names? This gives me a quick mental map.
            </p>
            <pre><code>import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
print(df.shape)
df.head()</code></pre>

            <h2>Step 2 — Check for the usual problems</h2>
            <p>
                Missing values, weird data types, duplicate rows — the usual stuff. I check
                for all of this early because it affects everything you do later. There's nothing
                worse than building a chart and realising halfway that half the column is null.
            </p>
            <pre><code>df.info()
df.isnull().sum()
df.duplicated().sum()</code></pre>

            <h2>Step 3 — Understand the distributions</h2>
            <p>
                For numeric columns, I check the spread — mean, median, min, max, standard
                deviation. For categorical columns, I look at value counts. The goal is to see
                if anything looks off or surprising.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                If a column has 95% of its values as the same thing, it's probably not going
                to be very useful.
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Step 4 — Visualise</h2>
            <p>
                This is where things get interesting. Histograms for distributions, scatter
                plots for relationships, box plots for outliers. I don't try to make them
                pretty at this stage — that comes later. Right now I just want to <strong>see
                    patterns</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 5 — Write down what you found</h2>
            <p>
                This is the step most people skip, and it's probably the most important one.
                After doing all the above, I write 3-5 bullet points about what I noticed.
                Things like "Sales peak in December," or "There's a weird spike in
                returns for Category X." These notes become the foundation for whatever
                analysis or report comes next.
            </p>

            <h2>That's basically it</h2>
            <p>
                EDA isn't complicated — it's just about being curious and systematic. The
                more datasets you explore, the faster you get at spotting what matters.
                Hope this helps if you're just getting started.
